# Home Credit Risk Prediction
*Celine Ng - December 2024*


This project contains 8 tables originally, a large amount of information. 
My method was to do tables aggregation right after a very brief 
understanding of 
what data/datatype/information was provided, and to only dive deeper into 
what meaning the data was providing afterward. 
However, another approach 
would be to first have a better understanding of the data/tables themselves 
and only select useful/meaning features/columns for aggregation and future 
processes.
